# 4.1. Write a program that read an integer and prints odd or even

number = int(input("enter an int number: "))

# if condition is true
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Even") # then it will run this code block
    
# if condition is true
if number % 2 == 1:
    print("Odd")  # then it will run this code block



# if you divide somethin with 2
# 
# if the remainder is 1 that is Odd.
# if the remainder is 0 that is Even
